new js runtime , faster

npm - node package manager 

npm init -y (create starting file package.json)

package.json - has info about all the imported packages and dev dependicies and lots of other things

package-lock.json - locks version of dependicies

npm i chalk - install chalk and adds to the project and updates package.json


using mjs as chalk uses higher level js
import chalk form "chalk" // modern import syntax
